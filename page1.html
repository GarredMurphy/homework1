            One example of a problem whose answer can be verified in polynomial time, but doesn't have a known way to find the answer in polynomial is a sukoku puzzle.
            If you increase the size of a sukoku puzzle grid, then the time it takes to solve rises at exponential rate, but the time it takes to check for mistakes once it is solved only increases at a polynomial rate.
            Problems of this type are known as NP problems, while problems that can be solved in polynomal time are known as P.  So does NP = P?
